This is a nice little pyplot (python) to visualize logistic maps for x_{n+1} = R * x_n ( 1 - x_n )}

Use the sliders below the figures to alter the parameters in real time.

The buttons under each plot labeled "Change Right/Left Plot" will allow you to view various other plot forms with the same data.

Final Next/Previous X allows you to view the coordinates of individual points on the left plot.
